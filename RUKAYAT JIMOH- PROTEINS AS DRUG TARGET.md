**Protein as Drug Targets**

Cancer is a disease that causes abnormal cells to divide uncontrollably and destroy body tissue (1). In cancer treatment, several types of proteins are targeted to disrupt cancer cell growth, survival, and spread (2). These targets are chosen based on their roles in cancer cell signaling, growth, and survival pathways (3). It becomes crucial to understand cancer biology, and behavior for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, ultimately improving patients' survival rates. Targeting specific proteins involved in cancer development and progression is a fundamental strategy in cancer therapy, some of which include oncogenes, tumor suppressor proteins, kinases, checkpoint proteins, proteins involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis-regulating proteins, hormone receptors, DNA repair proteins amongst others (4-6).

**Therapeutic Strategies**

Some treatment therapies involve identifying and producing inhibitors that bind to specific enzymes, receptors, or other proteins to reduce or block their activity. These inhibitors function by interfering with the normal function of the proteins that enable cancer progression, serving as an effective treatment method (7). Kinases are enzymes implicated in many cancer diseases, inhibitors like imatinib (targeting BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia), erlotinib (targeting EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer), and vemurafenib (targeting mutant BRAF in melanoma) are examples of kinase inhibitors that block the aberrant signaling pathways driving cancer growth (8). Overactive proteases are also responsible for many cancer cases (9). Treatment with inhibitors has become a valuable tool in both research and medicine.

Cancer cells produce antigens on their cell surfaces, monoclonal antibodies can be developed to bind specifically to these antigens on the surface of cancer cells. The antibodies block the function of the target antigen, mark the cancer cell for destruction by the immune system, or deliver cytotoxic agents directly to the cancer cell (10).

mRNA transcripts of oncogenes can also be targeted by molecules known as the small interfering RNA or the Antisense Oligonucleotides to effectively silence and reduce the production of proteins that drive cancer (11).

Peptide-based therapies are designed based on specific protein sequences from tumor antigens. They can act as vaccines to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. They may also mimic the structure and function of biologically active proteins and inhibit protein interactions involved in cancer progression (12).

**Conclusion**

The production of therapeutics that target specific proteins that drive cancer progression offers a promising and more effective approach to cancer treatment with fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. These targeted therapies improve personalized medicine approaches in oncology.
